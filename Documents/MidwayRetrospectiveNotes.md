#Midway Retrospective Notes

##Timeline
 * Kickoff meeting with client at Sogeti offices.  client gave us a list of user stores which was very helpful.
 * Development of top 1/3 of user stores from client's document. 
 * Created technical specification from user stories.
 * Check in meeting with Jim at Sogeti offices. Client reviewed the code and database diagrams we'd developed to that point and offered advice on how to continue moving forward.  In particular we learned that he was more interested in code quality that code functionality.  Jim also gave us clarification on some user stories.
 * Development continues with John W programming, Olivia working on the database, and John M acting as a project manager.
 * Weekly progress emails to client.

## What has worked and what hasn't?
###Good
  * Meeting with Jim *in person* has been very helpful.  It helps give us an idea of his expectations (eg, more interested in code quality than functionality).
  * Using user stories to guide development.  It keeps us from implementing more than we have to.
  * Iterative development with John W programming and then Olivia coming behind later and filling in database scripts, and finally John M creating tests.

###Bad
 * Weekly update emails with Jim haven't generated much response.  No news is good news?

## How are we going to fix what hasn't worked?
John M will take care of communicating these to the client.

 * We are going to press the client for feedback from the weekly update emails.  We'll ask that he responds to each item in the update even if it's just to say that it looks good.
 * Press client to create GitHub account so that he can review the code remotely.
