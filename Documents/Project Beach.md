Project BeachTime
Summary
BeachTime is an application that tracks consultants "on the beach", or between clients.  Users will register for the beach, upload their résumé, and tag their identities with useful metadata.  Account executives will be able to search for available consultants based upon the provided metadata.
Motivation
Sogeti consultants who are not actively billing a client are said to be "on the beach".  Each consultant has a skill set, but those skill sets differ greatly among consultants.  One consultant might develop on the Microsoft stack, while another may specialize in quality assurance.  It is difficult to know, at a glance, what skill sets are currently available.  BeachTime will consolidate this information, so that account executives can readily know what is available for placement at a new client.
