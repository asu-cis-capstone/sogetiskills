From this point onward, the project repo should include a folder called Tests and there should be some documentation in the README file about 'how to test' or 'how to run the tests'.  

Tests may be automated scripts or may be written documentation of manual test procedures.  

These may be "validation" tests, i.e. user tests or A/B tests that test whether the product serves the customer's needs, or "verification" tests that make sure the software is of good quality, doesn't have bugs, etc.  

Whatever type of testing you do, you must document how to carry out the tests.
